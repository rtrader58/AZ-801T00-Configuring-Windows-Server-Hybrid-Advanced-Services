## Module 04: Implementing Hyper-V Replica and Windows Server Backup

<br>

### Exercise1: Implementing Hyper-V Replica

<br>

Task 3: Validate a failover<br>
Step 6: You are not able to start the VM while it is replicating.  Move on to Exercise 2: Implementing backup and restore with Windows Server Backup – after completing come back and finish exercise 1 (My VM was still replicating – as long as you understand the concept you can end the lab if still replicating)
